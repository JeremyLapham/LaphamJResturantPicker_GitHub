Resturant Picker
The program will ask the user which type of food they want and will then select a random resturant with a random number
peer reviewed by: Marcel R. The program ran as intended, I liked how the choices branched even further and the random function works. If there was one thing I would say to let the play again function end on anything other than "yes" rather than "end", but the instructions do tell you what to type in what format, and even changes the uppercase or lowercase to make inputs more acceptable. Really fun program with interesting hot dog restaurants haha
